# AirBnB Clone - Deploy Static

## Description
This project is part of the AirBnB clone series. In this phase, we focus on deploying a static version of the AirBnB website, which includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This static deployment serves as the foundational front-end of the application that will later be integrated with the back-end.

The goal of this project is to:
- Learn the fundamentals of static web deployment.
- Use basic web technologies to create the front-end of a web application.
- Deploy a static website using a web server.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand how to structure and deploy a static website.
- Configure a basic web server to serve static files.
- Deploy the static website using a server, such as **Nginx** or **Apache**.
- Use **Git** for version control and collaboration.

---

## Requirements
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** or similar.
- **Python** 3.x and **pip**.
- Familiarity with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Linux commands**.
- Basic knowledge of web servers, particularly **Nginx** or **Apache**.

## Project Tasks

### 0. Setup Frontend Files
**Description**: Create the basic structure for the static web pages. This includes:
- HTML files for the main pages.
- CSS files for styling.
- JavaScript files for interactivity.

### 1. Configure Web Server
**Description**: Set up a web server (like **Nginx**) to serve the static files. This involves:
- Installing and configuring the web server.
- Defining the root directory where the static files are located.
- Ensuring the server serves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files correctly.

### 2. Deploy Static Website
**Description**: Deploy the website by uploading the static files to the server and starting the web server. Verify that the website is accessible via a browser.

### 3. Update with Version Control
**Description**: Use **Git** to manage changes to the project and ensure proper version control. Ensure that your code is pushed to a Git repository, such as **GitHub**.
